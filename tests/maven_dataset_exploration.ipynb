       " 'The shock had a moment magnitude of 7.7 and a maximum perceived intensity of IV (\"Light\") in Jakarta, the capital and largest city of Indonesia.',\n",
       " \"There were no direct effects of the earthquake's shaking due to its low intensity, and the large loss of life from the event was due to the resulting tsunami, which inundated a portion of the Java coast that had been unaffected by the earlier 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami that was off the coast of Sumatra.\",\n",
       " 'The July 2006 earthquake was also centered in the Indian Ocean, from the coast of Java, and had a duration of more than three minutes.',\n",
       " 'An abnormally slow rupture at the Sunda Trench and a tsunami that was unusually strong relative to the size of the earthquake were both factors that led to it being categorized as a tsunami earthquake.',\n",
       " 'Several thousand kilometers to the southeast, surges of several meters were observed in northwestern Australia, but in Java the tsunami runups (height above normal sea level) were typically and resulted in the deaths of more than 600 people.',\n",
       " 'Other factors may have contributed to exceptionally high peak runups of on the small and mostly uninhabited island of Nusa Kambangan, just to the east of the resort town of Pangandaran, where damage was heavy and a large loss of life occurred.',\n",
       " 'Since the shock was felt with only moderate intensity well inland, and even less so at the shore, the surge arrived with little or no warning.',\n",
       " 'Other factors contributed to the tsunami being largely undetected until it was too late and, although a tsunami watch was posted by an American tsunami warning center and a Japanese meteorological center, no information was delivered to people at the coast.',\n",
       " 'The Battle of Santa Clara took place on 27 July 1927, during the American occupation of Nicaragua of 1926–1933.',\n",
       " \"After being ambushed by Sandinista forces at the Battle of San Fernando, Major Oliver Floyd's expedition of American Marines and Nicaraguan Provisional Guardsmen continued its advance into enemy-held territory in northern Nicaragua.\",\n",
       " 'On the 27 July two American airplanes spotted forty Sandinistas waiting in ambush.',\n",
       " 'The aircraft received fire from an enemy machine gun and a dive bombing raid ensued, with three bombs being dropped on the Nicaraguan rebels.',\n",
       " 'The American aviators reported seeing six Sandinistas \"dead or seriously wounded.\"',\n",
       " \"Major Floyd's Marine and Provisional Guard expedition eventually reached the area one mile southeast of Santa Clara, where they were attacked by a force of between 60 and 120 (possibly up to 150) Sandinista insurgents who were armed with two machine guns.\",\n",
       " 'One of the machine guns was confirmed to be a Lewis gun and the other one was suspected of being one as well.',\n",
       " 'The battle raged from 2:30 to 4:00, with the Sandinistas being eventually driven back.',\n",
       " \"The American and Nicaraguan government forces didn't suffer any casualties, while five dead rebels were found on the battlefield.\",\n",
       " 'However, Augusto César Sandino would later admit to losing up to 60 men killed and wounded during the action (although this number may include the casualties from the air raid prior to the battle).',\n",
       " 'Sandino had a tendency to greatly exaggerate numbers related to the battles during his rebellion, so this number of 60 is probably inaccurate.',\n",
       " 'One young Sandinista, who was pretending to be dead, was captured, but later released.',\n",
       " \"In addition to human losses, twelve of Sandino's animals were killed and eight were captured.\",\n",
       " 'The clash at Santa Clara, along with the previous battles at Ocotal and San Fernando (both of which also took place in July 1927) convinced Sandino to alter his tactics.',\n",
       " 'According to author Neill Macaulay, \"he would attack only when the odds were heavily in his favor-when he clearly had the advantages of surprise, cover, and superior firepower.',\n",
       " \"Never again would he foolishly 'stand his ground,' nor would he try to redeem an attack that had hopelessly bogged down.\",\n",
       " 'Major Floyd might wage a \\'blood and thunder campaign,\\' but Sandino would adopt the hit-and-run tactics of guerrilla warfare.\"',\n",
       " 'After the Battle of Santa Clara, the Sandinistas fell back to \"the jungles around El Chipote mountain,\" which was \"ideal country for guerrilla warfare.\"',\n",
       " '\"For other sieges with this name, see Siege of Pondicherry (disambiguation)\" The Siege of Pondicherry was a colonial military operation in the early stages of the French Revolutionary Wars.',\n",
       " 'Britain and France both controlled colonies on the Indian Subcontinent and when the French National Convention declared war on Britain on 1 February 1793, both sides were prepared for conflict in India.',\n",
       " 'British India was centred on the principal ports of Bombay, Madras and Calcutta, administered by the East India Company.',\n",
       " 'French India was governed from Pondicherry (modern Puducherry) on the Coromandel Coast.',\n",
       " 'British forces in India were considerably stronger than the French, with the British Indian Army supported by British Army detachments and a Royal Navy squadron under Rear-Admiral William Cornwallis.',\n",
       " \"Pondicherry's defenses were strong, but the garrison was too small to effectively man the walls, and although a French frigate squadron was stationed at the distant Île de France, it was unable to effectively protect the French Indian coast.\",\n",
       " 'News of the outbreak of war took five months to reach the Indian Ocean but British forces, recently engaged in the Third Anglo-Mysore War, were mobilised in preparation and immediately seized the ports of French India.',\n",
